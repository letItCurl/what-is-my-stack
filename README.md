# Final thought
The vue frontend framework is not far from React. It has the adventage to have a more homogenous environment. In react we have hooks, module components, redux, redux-routes, redux-thunk... and each of them has a "clone" library.

Vue has the adventage to focus all potential problems in one file, since, in the .vue files, script / Style / Html are toegether.

This can be a huge advantage.

# How I feel after this 16h straight for those 3 projects:
